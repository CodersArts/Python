Hi there welcome back to my python tutorial,
Today i am going talk about most important topics that is pass statement.



The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. 
for instance ,we know that there is no provision of decalearing variable or function,or block without code or without definition.
just like, in java abstract concept we first declare  function prototype and definition late,the same thing can be achieved through 
pass statement in python 

For example:

>>> def Hello():
        pass
        
        
This function has only decalration and  definition can be later 
        
>>> while True:
...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
...

Also This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:


>>> class MyEmptyClass:
...     pass
...


Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, 
allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:

>>>
>>> def initlog(*args):
...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
...
