The web design world is constantly evolving. Every year, some trends are born, some fade and some just continue to prosper.
Much like pixels are to an image, these design elements come together to create the face of the internet as we know it.

It’s no secret that the graphic evolutions we view on our screens are often the results of giant tech and web companies innovations.
But design is also affected by a wide variety of time-sensitive elements such as fashion, news phenomena, cultural events and more.

So the million dollar question is: What are the hottest design trends for the upcoming year? We’re glad you asked!

A general overlook: before & after current trends
In this mobile era, everything we’re looking for is at our fingertips – literally, 
we just have to scroll in order to find it. 
Even on desktops, we’re addicted to our mouse wheel or trackpad and it’s mostly thanks to social networks. 
As websites get longer and longer (see long scrolling), images go coast-to-coast
and the rules of typography are changing to meet the needs of these new layouts.

To sum things up, website owners aren’t focusing anymore on
providing the most detailed information to their visitors, but are instead choosing to convey their message in the most efficient
and immediate way. Don’t misunderstand us: all the content is still there, it’s just displayed in a more streamlined and “sexy” way.
