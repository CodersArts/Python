Hello Everyone!
Welcome to the new series of Learing Python Programming language..
This is the second series of python programming and in this series i'm going to teach you how to use different  data structures in python.

When you hear the word Stack, the first thing that comes to your mind may be a stack of books, and we can use this analogy to explain stacks easily! Some of the commonalities include:

There is a book at the top of the stack (if there is only one book in the stack, then that will be considered the topmost book).
Only when you remove the topmost book can you get access to the bottom ones. No Jenga games here! (Also assume that you can only lift one book at a time).
Once you remove all the books from the top one by one, there will be none left and hence you cannot remove any more books.
The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append().
To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index. For example:


>>> stack = [3, 4, 5]
>>> stack.append(6)
>>> stack.append(7)
>>> stack
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
>>> stack.pop()
7
>>> stack
[3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> stack.pop()
6
>>> stack.pop()
5
>>> stack
[3, 4]
